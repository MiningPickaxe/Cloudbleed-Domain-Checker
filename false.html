  <title>Cloudflare Proxy Leak Domain Checker</title>
</head>
<body>
  This Domain did not use Cloudflare as a Proxy according to the database <a href="https://github.com/pirate/sites-using-cloudflare">'sites using cloudflare', created by Pirate</a>
  <br> <br>
  This is, however, no clear indicator whether requests were actually leaked or not because this list is incomplete and features domains not affected. Narrowing down the list is WIP.

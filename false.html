  <title>Cloudflare Proxy Leak Domain Checker</title>
</head>
<body>
  This Domain did not use Cloudflare as a Proxy according to the database from <a href="https://github.com/pirate/sites-using-cloudflare">Pirate on Github</a>
  <br> <br>
  This does not mean, that the Domain was not leaked, beause the leak was in Cloudflare Proxys and not Cloudflare DNS. We are currently working on testing for Cloudflare Proxys

  Make sure to invalidate session tokens by logging out & back in. It's recommended to also change your password in the process.

  This is, however, no clear indicator whether requests were actually leaked or not because this list is incomplete and features domains not affected. Narrowing down the list is WIP.
  <br>
  Nobody can be sure if requests of your entered domain were actually leaked, because search engine caches have been mostly scrubbed by now.
  <br>
  Please be aware of the fact that there may be more leaked domains which are not yet included in this list.

  <title>Cloudflare Proxy Leak Domain Checker</title>
</head>
<body>
  This Domain used Cloudflare during the affected time period.
  <br>
  <br>
  This does not mean, that data was leaked from them, but it is a possibility because the leak was in Cloudflare Proxyxs. I recommend changing your password though
  <br>
  Please be aware of the fact, that there may be more leaked domains, but they are not included in this list. Remember to change your passwords every few weeks to stay safe.
